I am a PhD student at the [Seismic Laboratory Imaging and Modeling ](https://slim.gatech.edu/) and in the job market for Spring 2025. 

My research is in machine learning for acceleration and uncertainty quantification of image reconstruction. My main research contributions are in implementing generative models that learn to sample from the Bayesian posterior of realistic high-dimensional imaging problems. My main applications are:

seismic imaging for carbon dioxide sequestration and monitoring to mitigate climate change...

but generally I focus on modalities governed by computationally expensive partial differential equations (PDEs).  These modalities are best suited for physics hybrid frameworks that are accelerated by machine learning but informed by traditional domain physics knowledge in the form of PDE simulations. I primarily consider myself an engineer since my passion is in scaling these novel techniques to real world applications.
