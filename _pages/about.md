I am a final semester PhD student and I am in the job market for Spring 2025

My research is in generative machine learning for uncertainty quantification of inverse problems. My main research contributions are in implementing and testing invertible networks that learn to sample from the Bayesian posterior of realistic inverse problems. I explore seismic imaging and medical imaging modalities (MRI, CT, Ultrasound, Photoacoustic) but generally focus on modalities governed by computationally expensive partial differential equations (PDEs). These modalities are best suited for physics hybrid frameworks that are accelerated by machine learning but informed by domain physics knowledge in the form of PDE simulations. I primarily consider myself an engineer since my passion is in bringing these novel techniques to real world applications.
