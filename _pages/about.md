I am a PhD student at the [Seismic Laboratory Imaging and Modeling ](https://slim.gatech.edu/) and in the job market for Spring 2025. 

My research is in generative machine learning for uncertainty quantification of inverse problems. My main research contributions are in implementing generative networks that learn to sample from the Bayesian posterior of realistic inverse problems. 

I explore seismic imaging for the application of carbon dioxide sequestration and monitoring...

...and medical imaging modalities (MRI, CT, Ultrasound, Photoacoustic)

but generally focus on modalities governed by computationally expensive partial differential equations (PDEs).  These modalities are best suited for physics hybrid frameworks that are accelerated by machine learning but informed by domain physics knowledge in the form of PDE simulations. I primarily consider myself an engineer since my passion is in bringing these novel techniques to real world applications.
