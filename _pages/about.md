I am a PhD candidate at the [Seismic Laboratory Imaging and Modeling ](https://slim.gatech.edu/) and in the job market for Spring 2025. 

My research is in machine learning for acceleration and uncertainty quantification of image reconstruction. During my PhD research, I implemented generative models that learn to sample from the Bayesian posterior of realistic high-dimensional imaging problems. My engineering mindset drives me to bridge the gap between innovative algorithms and practical applications, making these solutions impactful for industry needs.

My main applications are:

**seismic imaging** and **digital twin data assimilation** for monitoring of carbon dioxide sequestration to mitigate climate change...

Generally, I focus on imaging governed by computationally expensive partial differential equations (PDEs).  These modalities are best suited for physics hybrid frameworks that are accelerated by machine learning but informed by traditional domain physics knowledge in the form of PDE simulations. I primarily consider myself an engineer since my passion is in scaling these novel techniques to real world applications.
